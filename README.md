# GRIME
----
GRIME includes a GUI to accompany our image editor. This didn't require any actual design changes; our main method determines whether to run the text editor (MIME controller) or the GUI (GRIME controller) dependent on what the command line arguments are (-text for the text editor or -file for a script). There were new abstract classes and interfaces created to facilitate the use of the histograms and the JFrames in other classes (the GRIME controller). The implementation of new view has a JScrollPane at the top, which contains an image. Directly below it is the histogram in a JLabel. Below the JLabel is a series of JButtons that represent the operations that a user can do on the image. ALl of the buttons are functional. The user can type how much to increment the brightness by in the JTextField labeled increment. Currently, the image can be edited and all the buttons work, but the histogram is not yet implemented.
